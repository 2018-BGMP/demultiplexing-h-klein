I ran my python script on the test file using the following command:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}

cd /projects/bgmp/hklein3/BI624/Demultiplexing

module load python3/3.6.5

python3 demultiplexing.py -R1 /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz \
-R2 /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz \
-I1 /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz \
-I2 /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz \
-key indexes_key.txt -T 20 > demultiplexing_stats_20.txt

```

My file took ____ hours to run

Examples of the beginning of fastq outputs from the R1 and R2 files with index "AACAGCGA" and the undetermined files.
